# Implementaion of Chronical Map #

## Purpose ##
The purpose of this lab is to understand how to implement a RESTful persistent key-value data store using Chronicle Map.   

## Steps ##
  
You will be using the same three cache servers from the lab 2. However, you must use the assignment 3â€™s either consistent hashing or endezvous hashing implementation on the client side for this assignment to shard the data across the below three servers:  
A: http://localhost:3000  
B: http://localhost:3001  
C: http://localhost:3002  
{Key => Value}  
1 => a  
2 => b  
3 => c  
4 => d  
5 => e  
6 => f  
7 => g  
8 => h  
9 => i  
10 => j  
The limitation of the current implementation is the data will be lost whenever a node is goes down. To locally persist the data, you will use Chronicle Map to store the key-value hashmap into a file system. You are going to implement a new class called ChronicleMapCache using the same interface: CacheInterface and then replace the existing implementation with the new ChronicleMapCache.java. Finally, delete InMemoryCache.java from the code base.
